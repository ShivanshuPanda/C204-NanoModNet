# RNA Modification Predictor (Nanopore Signals)

This project uses a deep learning model (CNN + BiLSTM) to detect RNA modification sites directly from simulated or real Nanopore signals.

## Features
- Processes raw signal data
- Predicts binary RNA modification presence
- Uses Conv1D and BiLSTM layers
- Includes ROC curve, confusion matrix, and model saving

## How to Use
- Open in Google Colab
- Train on your dataset or simulated signals
- View performance metrics and save model

## Requirements
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
