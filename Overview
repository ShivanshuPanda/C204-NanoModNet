# C204-NanoModNet

## Overview

RNA modifications are chemical changes that occur on RNA molecules and affect how genes are expressed. Detecting these modifications is essential for understanding various biological processes and diseases.

## Objective

To develop a working neural network model that:

- Takes raw (or simulated) Nanopore signal data as input
- Predicts whether an RNA base is modified or not
- Visualizes model performance using standard metrics
- Runs entirely in Google Colab with no special setup

C204-NanoModNet is a deep learning-based model that predicts RNA modification sites directly from Nanopore sequencing signal data. It simulates how real lab experiments might be analyzed using AI — combining bioinformatics with neural networks.

| Layer               | Type             | Description                                   |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1                   | Conv1D           | Extracts local features from raw signals      |
| 2                   | MaxPooling1D     | Reduces signal length for efficiency           |
| 3                   | Conv1D           | Learns higher-order signal patterns            |
| 4                   | MaxPooling1D     | Further compression                            |
| 5                   | Bidirectional LSTM | Captures sequence context in both directions  |
| 6                   | Dense (64)       | Fully connected layer with dropout             |
| 7                   | Dense (1)        | Final output (binary classification)           |

Total Parameters: ~84,865

## Data Preprocessing

- Input signals are simulated/sourced from public RNA Nanopore datasets
- Signals are normalized (zero mean, unit variance) per sample
- Labels represent whether a given signal contains a modification or not

## Results

- Model trained for 10 epochs
- Accuracy varied between 50%–85% depending on simulation
- ROC-AUC visualizations show general learning behavior
- Confusion matrix helps visualize true/false predictions

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve and AUC

## Model Deployment

- Model saved in `.keras` format
- Can be reloaded for prediction without retraining
- Accepts new signals as input for inference

## Limitations

- Synthetic signal data may not fully match biological complexity
- More training epochs and real datasets would improve accuracy
- Future versions could add attention or transformer layers

## Conclusion

C204-NanoModNet is a functional prototype demonstrating how deep learning can assist in RNA modification prediction from raw signal data. It provides a foundation for building advanced bioinformatics tools and enables further exploration in AI-powered RNA research.
